# Summer Seminars at the Center for Hellenic Studies #

In addition to ongoing research at various affiliated institutions, the Center for the Hellenic Studies hosts a two-week seminar for undergraduates and their professors, during which they learn the total editing process used by the HMT and of course it's underlying principles in digital editing and oral traditional poetry.

Participants from around the world work intensively in teams of two to three, editing a given book of the *Iliad* and ultimately presenting on discoveries they have made during the editing process. Below you can find links to the project blog that features some of the work of seminars' past.
