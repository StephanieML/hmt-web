See our test system at <http://beta.hpcc.uh.edu/tomcat/hmtdigital/>.

Data in the central archive are automatically converted into an RDF graph, and loaded into an RDF server  each night.  

Test versions of new applications will be available here prior to publication of release versions of `hmtdigital`, but may not be stable.

We are working on a published release of the `hmtdigital` application to appear at <http://amphoreus.hpcc.uh.edu/hmtdigital/>.  Data will always be drawn from citable published  versions.   We are currently testing applications with the `2014.1` data release on <http://pelike.hpcc.uh.edu/hmtdigital/>.
