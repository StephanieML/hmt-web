# The Homer Multitext project: digital archive #


## Archival data
All of our editorial work is kept in simple text files:  TEI-conformant XML for our texts, and delimited text files (`.csv`, `.tsv`) for other structured data.  Teams develop drafts of their work in personal [git repositories][3];  when draft material passes a suite of automated tests, it is accepted in the HMT project [central repository on github][1], where the current archive of material provisionally accepted for publication is always freely available.  In addition, beginning in 2014, citable publications of  the data archive will be released approximately three times per year.  We will include more information on downloading published versions of the archive with our first issue `2014.1` is published.

In addition to our editorial work, the HMT project hosts an archive of [downloadable images][2].  All images are licensed under terms of various Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike licenses that define the terms under which we freely use these images and make them available to others.  Please see [detailed information about the licensing for each set of images][2], and note that some copyright holders restrict commercial use.  In these cases, parties interested in securing commercial rights should contact the copyright-holding institutions directly.


## Data services

All data in the central archive are automatically converted into an RDF graph every night, and loaded into an RDF server on a test machine.   We are currently running an end-user [application for viewing and retrieving material][4] on this test machine.

Our `2014.1` and subsequent citable publications will be available from a separate address, which will be linked here.
