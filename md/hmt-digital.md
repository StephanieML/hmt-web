# `hmt-digital`: online applications and data services #

We maintain two versions of the `hmt-digital` web application.

##Most current:  test system##

The most current version of `hmt-digital` is always available from our test system at <http://beta.hpcc.uh.edu/tomcat/hmt-digital/>.  New applications will be available here prior to publication of release versions of `hmt-digital`, but may not be stable.

In addition, data on the test system are drawn from nightly builds from our central archive.  This normally includes unpublished material that should not be cited for scholarly publication.


## Most stable ##

We are working on a published release of the `hmt-digital` application to appear at <http://amphoreus.hpcc.uh.edu/hmt-digital/>.  Data will always be drawn from citable published  versions.   We are currently testing applications with the published `2014.1` data release on <http://pelike.hpcc.uh.edu/tomcat/hmt-digital/>.
