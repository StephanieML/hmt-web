# The Homer Multitext project: digital archive #


## Archival data ##

Beginning in 2014, citable publications of  the HMT project data archive are being [released approximately three times per year](http://homermultitext.blogspot.com/2014/02/publishing-hmt-archive.html).  Zip files can be manually downloaded from <http://beta.hpcc.uh.edu/hmt/archival-publications/>, or retrieved using these [maven coordinates](maven.html).


All of our editorial work is kept in simple text files:  TEI-conformant XML for our texts, and delimited text files (`.csv`, `.tsv`) for other structured data.  Teams develop drafts of their work in personal [git repositories][3];  when draft material passes a suite of automated tests, it is accepted in the HMT project [central repository on github][1], where the current archive of material provisionally accepted for publication is always freely available.  

In addition to our editorial work, the HMT project hosts an archive of [downloadable images][2].  All images are licensed under terms of various Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike licenses that define the terms under which we freely use these images and make them available to others.  Please see [detailed information about the licensing for each set of images][2], and note that some copyright holders restrict commercial use.  In these cases, parties interested in securing commercial rights should contact the copyright-holding institutions directly.
