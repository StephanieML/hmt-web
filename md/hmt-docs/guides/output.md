# What we create in editing for HMT #


## In page-by-page editing ##


- Paleographic samples:  a CITE Collection, recorded as a `.csv` file in the project's `collections` directory
- Index of *Iliad* lines to default image:  a CITE Index, recorded as simple pairs of URNs (*Iliad* line and image) in a `.csv` file in the project's `indices` directory
- Inventory of scholia on a page:  multiple CITE Collections (one for each class of scholia) recorded as `.csv` files in the `collections` directory
- Diplomatic edition of *Iliad* and of scholia:  TEI-conformant XML files, in the subdirectories of the project's `editions` directory.
