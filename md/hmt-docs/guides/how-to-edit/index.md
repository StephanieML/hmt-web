# The editing process #

## Modelling a codex ##



1. make an ordered collection of pages
2. if necessary, make composite images of bifolio spread (necessary when page layout is organized by bifolio spread, rather than by individual page as in the Escorial Upsilon 1.1, or the Venetus B)
2. index primary or default image to each page
3. define region of interest on default image for physical page
4. record URN of first and last line of the *Iliad* for every page that has *Iliad* text
