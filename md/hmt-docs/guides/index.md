# Guides for contributors #


## Current draft material ##


In 2014, we are standardizing on a set of templates and tools that all contributors run in a Homer Multiext project virtual machine.  We are updating our guides to reflect this:   draft documentation is available from the [web pages for the 2014 summer seminar](../../summer2014).


## Stable location for reference material ##


- The HMT editorial process: see [this outline](how-to-edit/index.html) for an overview: as sections of our draft guide are moved to this site, they will be linked from the outine.
- Reference manual: "house style" for XML editing
- Some tips and tricks
