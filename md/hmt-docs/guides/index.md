# Guides for contributors #

In 2014, we are standardizing on a set of templates and tools that all contributors run in a Homer Multiext project virtual machine.  We are updating our guides to reflect this:   draft documentation is available from the [web pages for the 2014 summer seminar](../../summer2014).
