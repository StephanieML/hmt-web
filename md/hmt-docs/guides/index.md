# Guides for contributors #



In 2014, we are standardizing on a set of templates and tools that all contributors run in a Homer Multitext project virtual machine.  We are updating our guides to reflect this:  some draft documentation is still available from the [web pages for the 2014 summer seminar](../../summer2014).
