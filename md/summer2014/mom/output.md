## Visual inventory of texts indexed to images ##

- `build/visualinventory/inventory.xml` is an XML file you can open in a web browser to inspect the spatial layout of your indices.  (**NB**: Chrome's default security settings will not load the javascript file that is used to overlay your indices on an image;  Safari or Firefox will open the file without problems using default settings.)
