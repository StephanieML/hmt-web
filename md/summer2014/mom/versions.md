# What is validated in each version of MOM #



**MOM 0.4.0**:  validates using `citemgr`'s tests for referential integrity of the generic relations of the Digital Scholarly Editions model:  text URNs, CITE Object URN for physical artifact ("text-bearing surface"), and Image URN for documentary visual evidence are all connected in a consistent triangle of references.
