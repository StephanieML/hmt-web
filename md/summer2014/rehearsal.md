## Instructions ##

Each group should prepare a 10-minute presentation addressing *one* interesting question raised by your work editing the Venetus A.

Your presentation should cover the following questions:

1. What is the question your group looked at, and why is it interesting?
2. What primary evidence did you look at?
3. How does the evidence inform us about your question? 
4. What conclusions did you reach?

Optionally, you may also suggest further directions your presentation points to for future work.
