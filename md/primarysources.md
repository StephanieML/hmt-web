## Venetus A (Marciana 454 = 822) ##

The manuscript Marcianus Graecus Z. 454 [= 822], known to Homeric scholars as the Venetus A, is the oldest complete text of the *Iliad* in existence. It was acquired by the Greek Cardinal Basileus Bessarion in the 15th century CE and donated together with his entire collection of Greek manuscripts to the Republic of Venice, thereby forming the Marciana library's initial collection. It is vellum, and was constructed at the end of the 10th century CE. Its size is 39.5cm by 28.5/29cm, with 327 leaves. Several items have been added to the manuscript by later hands, including some short glosses in the exterior margins and between the lines of the poem. A typical folio in the Venetus A contain 25 lines of Homeric text, surrounded on all sides by up to five distinct sets of scholia (marginal, intermarginal, interior, exterior, and interlinear). Main scholia are coordinated with the text via lemmata (short quotations of the relevant text), while the other scholia are linked primarily by relative placement. Other texts of the Venetus A include: excerpts from Proclus' *Chrestomathy* (the *Life of Homer* and summaries of all of the poems of the now lost Epic Cycle except the *Cypria*) and Aristonicus' work *On the signs of Aristarchus*. Painted around this text and in one case over it are illuminations from the twelfth century CE. These illuminations depict mythological scenes from the Judgment of Paris up to the fighting of the Trojan War. The text also notably includes critical signs, which are associated with the edition and commentary of Aristarchus.

## Venetus B (Marciana 453 = 821) ##

The manuscript Marcianus Graecus Z. 453 [= 821], known to Homeric scholars as the Venetus B, was produced in the 11th century CE. Like the Venetus A, it was acquired by the Greek Cardinal Basileus Bessarion in the 15th century CE and donated together with his entire collection of Greek manuscripts to the Republic of Venice, thereby forming the Marciana Library's initial collection. It is one of the oldest surviving manuscripts of the *Iliad* and contains an important body of marginal scholia. 
The manuscript consists of 338 folios (40.5 x 31.5 cm). The 11th-century text and scholia were written by two contemporary scribes. A typical folio in the Venetus B contains between twelve and twenty-four lines of the Homeric text surround by a large body of scholia on three sides. On many folios the space around the scholia that surrounds the text of the *Iliad* is surrounded by additional layers of scholia in a later (13th-century) hand. According to Erbse (1969), these are generally mythological scholia and glosses taken from lexica or from the *Epimerismi Homerici*. The far margins contain material from Porphyry's *Homeric Questions* and from Pseudo-Heraclitus' Ἀλληγορίαι Ὁμηρικαί. Where space was left by earlier scribes, a scribe of a still later period added material from the *Etymologicum Magnum*, the *Suda*, and the *Epimerismi Homerici*. The Venetus B has a different method of coordinating text with the commentary in the margins from that of the Venetus A. (It also has different content in its commentary.) Numbers are used, comparable to footnote numbers, to link the commentary to the text.

## Marciana 458 (841 = Allen U4) ##

Marciana 458 is a 12th or 13th century CE manuscript of the *Iliad*. The original text was two volumes, the first of which is now lost to us. The remaining half, which picks up in the middle of Book 14 and continues through the rest of the *Iliad* remains to us in the Marciana 458. While it contains fewer scholia than some of the other manuscripts, the Venetus A for instance, it does contain a Byzantine Greek translation of the *Iliad* written in prose alongside the poem. It is a lesser known manuscript and has since received comparatively less scholarship.

## Escorial Y I.1 (294 = Allen E3) ##

Escorial Y I.1 (=Allen’s E3, West E) is an 11th century parchment codex consisting of 336 folios, containing a complete text of the *Iliad* with accompanying scholia. The scholia of this manuscript are closely related to those of the Venetus B; Maniaci (2006) has argued that the Venetus B and Y I.1 are “twins.” The Y I.1 also uses a numerical system to associate its commentaries with specific lines of text. The manuscript contains a second, apparently later hand, found primarily in the interlinear and intermarginal spaces. This manuscript is particularly interesting for study where it differs from its supposed “twin” as well as the other manuscripts.

## Escorial Ω I.12 (513 = Allen E4) ##

Escorial Ω.I.12 (=Allen's E4, West F) is an 11th century parchment codex, thought by Allen to be later than Υ.1.1, consisting of 216 folios containing a complete text of the *Iliad*, a commentary with lemmata on *Iliad* 1–2.300, hypotheses, lives of Homer, a summary of the *Cypria* and the *Batrachomyomachia* (“Battle of Frogs and Mice”), excerpts from Porphyry, and other scholia. According to Allen (1931:148), E4 is not related to any of the other early minuscule manuscripts. The manuscript contains at least two distinct hand and at least three colors of ink: black, a purplish-red, and an orangish red. The reds are used for titles, decoration, lemmata, ‘footnote’ symbols, initial letters on lines of poetry that begin a new “section,” such as lines that end a direct speech/change speakers. The binding is 16th century.

## Genevensis 44 ##

The “Geneva Iliad” was most likely produced in Constantinople in the 13th century. The manuscript was purchased in the 16th century, probably in Venice, by Henri Estienne, who used this manuscript as a basis for his 1566 edition of the *Iliad*, which remained the standard edition into the 18th century. This manuscript is unique for numerous scholia, which are not found in any other similar manuscript. It is also notable for it’s prose paraphrase, present through the first half of the text.
