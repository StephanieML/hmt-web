# The Homer Multitext: home page #


Welcome! The Homer Multitext project seeks to present the Homeric *Iliad* and *Odyssey* in a critical framework that accounts for the fact that these poems were composed orally over the course of hundreds, if not thousands of years by countless singers who composed in performance. The evolution and the resulting multiformity of the textual tradition, reflected in the many surviving texts of Homer, must be understood in its many different historical contexts. Using technology that takes advantage of the best available practices and open source standards that have been developed for digital publications in a variety of fields, the Homer Multitext offers free access to a library of texts and images and tools to allow readers to discover and engage with the Homeric tradition.

The Homer Multitext is a long-term project emphasizing collaborative research (we are particularly interested in undergraduate research), openly licensed data, and innovative uses of technology. The Homer Multitext welcomes collaboration in the form of diplomatic editions, images of historical documents, and translations. All material must be openly licensed and attribution will be given to the contributors. Please contact Casey Dué (casey@chs.harvard.edu) and Mary Ebbott (ebbott@chs.harvard.edu).
